						Competency Questions
					</h2>
					<h4>
						Here are three competency questions with short answers
						specifically related to encoding the analysis of
						connections in Houshang Golshiri's short story "The Man
						with the Red Tie":
					</h4>
					<p>
						1-How can textual data from Houshang Golshiri's "The Man
						with the Red Tie" be encoded for analysis?
					</p>
					<p>
						2-What encoding methods can be employed to represent
						relationships or connections between elements in the
						short story "The Man with the Red Tie"?
					</p>
					<p>
						3-How does encoding the analysis of connections in "The
						Man with the Red Tie" contribute to a deeper

						Data Modeling
					</h2>
					<h4>
						I used FRBR in my project to represent the relationships
						between different levels of bibliographic resources,
						such as works, expressions, and manifestations. This
						modeling approach helps me organize and describe
						resources more precisely and understand how they relate
						to each other in the context of my project. It allows
						for a more detailed and structured representation of
						bibliographic data, making it easier to manage and
						analyze the resources.

					<img src="./img/Untitled Diagram.drawio (1).png" style="border:#8e0000 solid;"/>
					<p>
						<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
						We know that the choice depends on the level of detail
						and complexity required for project. If We need
						comprehensive bibliographic modeling, FABIO or FRBR may
						be suitable. For a simpler project, We could consider
						Dublin Core Terms or Dublin Core. It's essential to
						select an ontology that aligns with our project's
						specific needs and avoids unnecessary complexity.

										Analysis
									</h2>
									<h4>
										I decided to perform <span style="color: red;">some analysis like Text analysis , vocabulary analysis and text visualization </span> as part of my research, and I'll explain why I chose this approach:
									</h4>
									
									<p>I decided to delve into text analysis, vocabulary analysis, and visual analysis because I wanted to gain deeper insights into textual data. Each of these methods serves a specific purpose in understanding and interpreting text.</p>

									<p>First, text analysis enables me to break down a large body of text into manageable components, revealing patterns, trends, and key themes. It helps me comprehend the overall structure and content of the text, making it easier to navigate and derive meaningful information.</p>
										
									<p>Second, vocabulary analysis is essential for understanding the language used in the text. By examining word frequencies, unique word forms, and common phrases, I can gain a better grasp of the author's style and the specific terms or concepts discussed. This deepens my comprehension of the text and its nuances.</p>
										
									<p>Finally, visual analysis is a powerful tool for presenting textual data in a more accessible and engaging manner. Visualizations, such as word clouds and dispersion plots, allow me to quickly identify prominent words, their relationships, and their distribution throughout the text. Visual representations make it easier to communicate my findings to others and highlight important aspects of the text.</p>
										
									<p>In summary, my choice of text analysis, vocabulary analysis, and visual analysis is driven by the need to uncover the underlying structure, language, and key elements within the text. These techniques help me extract valuable insights, ultimately enhancing my ability to interpret and convey the significance of the textual data.</p>	
									<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Text analysis, vocabulary analysis, and visual analysis techniques are more closely related to "close reading" rather than "distant reading"
									<p>text analysis and vocabulary analysis are methods often used in close reading, where the focus is on a single text or a smaller collection of texts. Visual analysis can be applied to both close reading and distant reading, as it provides a visual representation of textual data that can be useful for understanding both individual texts and larger corpora.</p>

										TEI Header
									</h2>
									<p>
										As we know the TEI header serves the purpose of
										providing essential metadata and
										contextual information about the encoded
										document. It includes details about the
										title, author, translator, publisher,
										publication place, publication date, and
										the source of the text. This metadata is
										crucial for cataloging, referencing, and
										preserving the document's provenance and
										context, making it valuable for scholars
										and researchers in the field of digital
										humanities and textual analysis.
										I have used elements from the TEI header to provide metadata for a text. The TEI header elements used in this project:
									<ol>
										<li>
											&lt;titleStmt&gt;: This section provides information about the title of the text.
											<ul>
												<li>
													&lt;title&gt; : the title of the text, which is "The Man with the Red Tie."
												</li>
												<li>&lt;title type="original"&gt; : The original title of the text, provided in the Persian language, which is "مردی با کروات سرخ" (Man with a Red Tie).</li>
												<li>
													&lt;author&gt; : The author
													of the document is "Houshang
													Golshiri."
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											&lt;respStmt&gt; : This part is responsible for indicating who encoded the text. It includes the following elements:
											<ul>
												<li>
													&lt;resp&gt; : Specifies the type of responsibility, which, in this case, is "Encoded by."
												<li>
													&lt;name&gt; : It mentions the name of the person encoded the text, which is "Atousa Heidarnia."(me)
												</li>

										<li>&lt;editionStmt&gt;: This element is used to convey information about the edition of the text, and in this case, it mentions that this is the "First Edition."</li>
										   <ul>
											<li>&lt;extent&gt; : This section describes the nature of the text. It is noted that the text is a "Short Story in Collection," providing context about its content</li>
										   </ul>
										<li>
											&lt;publicationStmt&gt; : This part contains details related to the publication of the text. It includes the following elements:
											<ul>
												<li>
													&lt;publisher&gt; : The
													document was published by
													"Mage Publishers."
												</li>

										Verse module
									</h2>
									<p>
										The module selected for my project is
										the "verse" module in TEI. This module
										is designed for encoding texts that
										consist mostly or entirely of verse,
										especially when the elements provided by
										the core module for encoding verse
										structure are insufficient. Tags for
										Verse, encompass elements designed for
										encoding various aspects of verse,
										including individual lines and groups of
										lines like stanzas. It's important to
										note that these elements can be employed
										in any TEI document, regardless of the
										specific module being used. In a manner
										similar to how the modules for prose and
										drama function, the verse module also
										relies on the structure defined.This
										structure helps define the fundamental
										organizational components of a text,
										including front matter, the main body of
										the text, and any concluding sections,
										and it provides tools for further
										subdividing these sections into smaller
										units as needed.
									</p>
								
									<p>
										Like other kinds of text, texts written
										in verse may be of widely differing
										lengths and structures.verse texts,
										including poems of varying lengths and
										structures, can be encoded like any
										other text. When dealing with a group of
										poems, you have the option to either
										treat them as one whole unit or as
										individual texts, depending on your
										perspective and how you want to present
										the content. Further resources or
										discussions may provide specific
										guidelines for encoding collections of
										poems.
									</p>
									<p>Here's a detailed explanation of the TEI elements that I used in this text:</p>
									<ol>
                                     <li>&lt;text&gt; :  This is the root element of the TEI document, encompassing the entire text.</li>
									 <li>&lt;body&gt; : Within the TEI document, this element contains the main content of the text.</li>
									 <li>&lt;div n=" "&gt; : This element indicates a  textual division (like division 1).The n attribute with the value " " is used to label the division.</li>
									 <li>&lt;pb facs=" "&gt; : This element references a page break. The facs attribute with the value for example "#page1" indicates that it's a reference to a specific page in the document.</li>
									 <li>&lt;head&gt; :This element marks the title or heading of the section. In this case, it's "The Man with the Red Tie." </li>
									 <li>&lt;note location="top right"&gt; : This element is used to provide additional information. It specifies that the text is "Dedicated to: Abolhasan Najafi" and should be placed at the "top right" location.</li>
									 <li>&lt;p&gt; : This element is used for marking paragraphs in the text, separating them for readability</li>
  
                                     <li>&lt;add&gt; ,&lt;del&gt; ,&lt;unclear&gt; ,&lt;l&gt; : These are inline elements used for text annotation and formatting.
										These are inline elements used for text annotation and formatting.<ul>
											<li>&lt;add&gt; : Indicates added text or content. </li>
											<li>&lt;del&gt; : Marks deleted or omitted text.  </li>
											<li>&lt;unclear&gt; :  Indicates uncertainty or unclear text. </li>
											<li>&lt;l&gt; : Represents lines within a paragraph. </li>

										</ul>
									 </li>
									<li>&lt;note place="margin left" xml:lang="fa"&gt; :This  element contains a note placed in the margin on the left side and is in the Persian language ("fa"). </li></ol>
									<br>
									<p>
										The &lt;facsimile&gt; element is used in TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) to include facsimile images or visual representations of the text's original pages. In this case, the &lt;facsimile&gt; element is used to reference images of the text's pages.</p>
										<p>&lt;surface xml:id="page1"&gt;, &lt;surface xml:id="page2"&gt;, and so on: These &lt;surface&gt; elements are used to specify individual pages within the facsimile. The xml:id attribute with unique identifiers such as "page1," "page2," and so on is used to link the facsimile images to specific pages in the encoded text.</p>
										<p>&lt;graphic url="..."&gt; : The &lt;graphic&gt; element is used to specify the URL or location of the facsimile image for each page. Each &lt;graphic&gt; element contains a url attribute pointing to the image file.</p>

							Conclusion
					</h2>
					<p>The theme of the story "The Man with the Red Tie" is primarily centered around the narrator's curiosity and attempts to gather information about a mysterious individual, Mr. S.M. Throughout the narrative, the narrator engages with various people, like the grocer, the next-door neighbor, and others, in an effort to learn more about Mr. S.M.'s habits and lifestyle. The story explores how curiosity can drive individuals to seek information about others, often with an underlying desire for connection or understanding. While the story doesn't explicitly reveal a central theme, it hints at the complexities of human interactions, the desire for knowledge, and the potential for misunderstandings when trying to uncover someone else's life.</p>
					<p>
						In conclusion, the utilization of text analysis, vocabulary analysis, and visual analysis has significantly enriched our comprehension of textual data, allowing for the discovery of patterns, linguistic nuances, and key themes within the text. Looking ahead, future developments in this research may encompass the refinement and expansion of these analytical methods to encompass a wider array of texts and subjects. This broader scope will facilitate more comprehensive comparisons and a deeper understanding of language and themes within the larger literary context. Additionally, ongoing exploration of advanced text analysis tools and visualization techniques will contribute to a more thorough examination of textual data, promoting a deeper understanding of the intricacies of literary works and enhancing the effective communication of our findings to a broader audience.

					</h2>
				    <p>I am excited to present a proposal for an ambitious project aimed at digitizing the complete works of the Golshiri. While a significant portion of Golshiri's works has already been generously donated to Stanford University Library in print and handwritten form by his family, I am committed to expanding this collection by creating a comprehensive digital archive. This project is driven by a desire to preserve his literary legacy and make it accessible to a wider audience, researchers, and enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
