    <p> so much for <del reason="omitted">that</del> them. But I talked to the
    <l>baker and even to the barbecue stall holder on the</l>
    <l>other side of the road/street, I learned that he</l>
    <l><del reason="redundant">bought a couple</del></l>
    <l>bought a couple of Flat loaves in the morning and</l>
    <l>a mere  one either at noon or in the evening and</l>
    <l>that by the time he got/reached home he had usually</l>
    <l>eaten half of a loaf on its own and that sometimes he'd</l>
    <l>come in late and buy a leftover loaf to eat for his</l>
    <l>dinner. There wasn't even anywhere else or any other</l>
    <l>way for him to go and fritter away his money. <unclear reason="dehyphenation">Naturally</unclear></l>
    <l>he'd wet his whistle/give himself a drink too</l>
    <l>of an evening, but that pretty briefly/fleetingly</l>
    <l>also, with a pepsi and sometimes a haricot-bean.</l>
    <l>And then before he'd even finished his first </l>
    <l>cupful he'd light up a cigarette. Indeed he really</l>
    <l>did smoke very heavily. But I mustn't write form</l>
    <l>later notes, leave those until later.</l>

    <l>A plump lady/woman answered the door, she had</l>
    <l>dark eyes and eyebrows, tinted too. She looked</l>

    <l>well, I'm not quite on crutches yet.</l>
    <l><q>Good Day Ma'am,</q> I said , <q>Excuse me but does</q></l>

    <l>Mr. ... house.</l>

    <l><q>Oh no,</q> she said, But when he has one of his</l>
    <l>turns... no, but I do wish (for god'sakes) you'd </l>
    <l>ask Mr. S.M. to watch the moon/keep out of the</l>
    <l>moonlight/walk less under the stars."</l>
    <l>We talked a lot. As I said she wasn't a bad</l>
    <l>sort so I asked her:</l>
    <l>"Do you think you could give him a message/ could</l>
    <l> I leave a message with you, it's nothing really..."</l>

    <p> But I was at a loss/stumped as to what to say.
    <l>All I really/<add>I only</add> wanted to know was whether</l>
    <l>he was on good terms with this woman or not.</l>
    <l>I never found out. Although later I discovered</l>             
    <l>that... well, leave that until later. What I </l>
    <l><note place="above">did learn from</note> learned from my conversation with the woman, however,</l>
    <l>amounted to this:</l>
    <l>1 - Mr. S.M. has turns/walks in the moonlight.</l>
    <l>When? The time is not definite./ <add>At no</add> </l>
    <l>specific time. He also smokes.</l>
    <l>2 - He plays foreign records at night and  <unclear reason="dehyphenation">sometimes</unclear> </l>
    <l>sings himself too. He has a soft</l>
    <l>pleasant voice.  These could be considered</l>
    <l>reliable distinguishing characteristics./</l>

    <l>on a reliable source.</l>
    <l>3 - He keeps his light on late/<add>until late at night.</add></l>

    <p>it <add>(sometimes) in passing.</add>
    <l>4 - Whenever he goes out, he always has/ <add>he's</add></l>
    <l>always got several books under his arms</l>
    <l>and a cigarette between his lips. </l>
    <l>5 - He's unmarried. /<add>He hasn't got a wife.</add></l>
    <l><add>(The little woman laughed.)</add><del reason="omitted"> Is he good</del></l>
    <l>So he's good looking.  Mr.S.M. I mean.</l>
    <l>His photograph doesn't show/<dd>reveal</dd> such things.</l>
    <l>We ought to <del reason="omitted">ask</del> request that the photograph</l>
    <l>in his file be changed.</l>
    <l>I said goodbye to the woman. I don't know</l>
    <l>Would you like to compile/ <add>do</add> a file on her also?</l>
    <l>Its completely up to you, Naturally <add place="above"> of course</add>. If you do, fill</l>
    <l>in <del reason="omitted">the</del> <add place="above">her</add> distinguishing characteristics. She had a </l>
    <l>mole just by the dimple in her chin. Black hair,</l>

    <l>Her tchador was always slipping off/ <add>down</add> and I </l>
